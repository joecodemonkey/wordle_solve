## Usage

    never
    gonna
```

- **Guess** causes Worldle Solver to guess the next word in the puzzle.
- Clicking the letters toggles them from:
  - Green - (present in correct position) to
  - Yellow - (present in the word but not in the correct position) to
  - black (not present in the word)
- ðŸš« removes a word from the dictionary and tries again.
- **Play Again** restarts guessing without downloading the dictionary.
